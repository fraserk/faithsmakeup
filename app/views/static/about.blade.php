            <p>My love for makeup began as a hobby. I would spend hours playing with colors that caused my eyes to pop and glosses that made my lips pout. As a graduate of a licensed professional school of makeup artistry, I’m now committed to making everyone look and feel beautiful. It’s my passion! Products and tools make me squeal. I take delight in learning new techniques. I’m up for challenges and can appreciate understated beauty. I love what I do…now tell me what I can do for you.</p>
